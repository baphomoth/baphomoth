# About me

As a dedicated cybersecurity student and active CTF participant, I have hands-on experience in system administration, network creation, and developing security tools using Python, Bash, and Powershell. With a strong focus on ethical hacking, I hold certifications like ISC2's CC and TCM Security's Practical Junior Penetration Tester. I actively contribute to cybersecurity NGOs, like Hackout and participating in bug bounty programs. I am passionate about continuous learning through industry conferences like BSides and DefCamp.
